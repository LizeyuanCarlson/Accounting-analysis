# Accounting-analysis

In 1938, Frank Benford found that a large number of naturally-occurring datasets follow this pattern:
  Surface areas of rivers, molecular weights, death rates, street addresses, and the numbers contained in an issue of Readers 
  Digest.
"Benfords Law" has been used to detect irregularities in:
  Published scientific studies, fraudulent election data in Iran, suspicious macroeconomic data from Greece, and tax return
  misreporting.

It could work to detect fraud in accounting because revenue=price * quantity summed across a large number of transactions.
